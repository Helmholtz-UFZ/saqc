SaQC - System for automated Quality Control
===========================================

Quality Control of numerical data requires a significant amount of
domain knowledge and practical experience. Finding a robust setup of
quality tests that identifies as many suspicious values as possible, without
removing valid data, is usually a time-consuming endeavor,
even for experts. SaQC is both, a Python framework and a command line application, that
addresses the exploratory nature of quality control by offering a
continuously growing number of quality check routines through a flexible
and simple configuration system.
Below its user interface, SaQC is highly customizable and extensible.
A modular structure and well-defined interfaces make it easy to extend
the system with custom quality checks. Furthermore, even core components like
the flagging scheme are exchangeable.
