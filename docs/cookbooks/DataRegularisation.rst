Data Regularization
===================

The tutorial aims to introduce the usage of ``SaQC`` methods, in order to obtain regularly sampled data derivatives
from given time series data input. Regularly sampled time series data, is data, that exhibits a constant temporal
spacing in between subsequent data points.

In the following steps, the tutorial guides through the usage of the *SaQC* :doc:`resampling <../funcs/generic>`
library.

#. Initially, we introduce and motivate regularization techniques and we do import the tutorial data.

Why Regularization?
-------------------

Often, measurement data does not come in regularly sampled time series. The reasons, why one usually would
like to have time series data, that exhibits a constant temporal gap size
in between subsequent measurements, are manifold.

The 2 foremost important ones, may be, that statistics, such as *mean* and *standard deviation*
usually presuppose the set of data points, they are computed of, to
be equally weighted.

The second reason, is, that, relating data of different sources to another, is impossible, if one
has not a mapping at hand, that relates the different date time indices to each other. One easy and intuitive
way of constructing such a mapping, is to just resample all data at the same (regular) timestamp.

Tutorial Data
-------------

The following `dataset <../resources/data/SoilMoisture.csv>`_ of Soil Moisture measurements may serve as
example data set:


.. image:: ../resources/images/cbooks_soil_moisture.png
   :target: ../resources/images/cbooks_soil_moisture.png
   :alt:


Lets import it and check out the first and last lines.
.. doctest:: example

   >>> import pandas as pd
   >>> data_path = './resources/data/SoilMoisture.csv'
   >>> data = pd.read_csv(data_path, index_col=0)
   >>> data.index = pd.DatetimeIndex(data.index)

The data series seems to start with a sampling rate of roughly *10* minutes.
Somewhere the sampling rate changes, and at the end it seems to exhibit an intended sampling
rate of *15* minutes.

Finding out about the proper sampling a series should be regularized to, is a subject on its own and wont be covered
here. Usually, the intended sampling rate of sensor data is known from the specification of the sensor.

If that is not the case, and if there seem to be more than one candidates for a rate regularization, a rough rule of
thumb, aiming at minimization of data loss and data manipulation, may be,
to go for the smallest rate seemingly present in the data.

Regularization
--------------

So lets transform the measurements timestamps to have a regular *10* minutes frequency. In order to do so,
we have to decide what to do with each time stamps associated data, when we alter the timestamps value.

Basically, there are three types of :doc:`regularization <../funcs/resampling>` methods:


#. We could keep the values as they are, and thus,
   just :ref:`shift <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:Shift>` them in time to match the equidistant *10* minutes frequency grid, we want the data to exhibit.
#. We could calculate new, synthetic data values for the regular timestamps, via an :ref:`interpolation <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:Interpolation>` method.
#. We could apply some :ref:`aggregation <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:Aggregation>` to up- or down sample the data.

Shift
-----

Lets apply a simple shift via the :py:meth:`~saqc.SaQC.shift` method.

.. doctest::

   >>> import saqc
   >>> qc = saqc.SaQC(data)
   >>> qc = qc.shift('SoilMoisture', target='SoilMoisture_bshift', freq='10min', method='bshift')


Target parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We selected a new ``target`` field, to store the shifted data to a new field, so that our original data wouldn't be
overridden.

Freq parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We passed the ``freq`` keyword of the intended sampling frequency in terms of a
`date alias <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases>`_ string. All of
the :doc:`regularization <../funcs/resampling>` methods have such a frequency keyword,
and it just determines the sampling rate, the resulting regular timeseries will have.

Shifting Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the ``method`` keyword, we determined the direction of the shift. We passed it the string ``bshift`` -
which applies a *backwards* shift, so data points get shifted *backwards*\ , until they match a timestamp
that is a multiple of *10* minutes. (See :py:meth:`~saqc.SaQC.shift` documentation for more
details on the keywords.)

Lets see, how the data is now sampled. Therefore, we use the ``data`` Attribute from the
:py:class:`SaQC <saqc.core.core.SaQC>` object. This will prevent the methods output from
being merged to a ``pandas.DataFrame`` object, and the changes from the resampling will be easier
comprehensible from one look.

We see, the first and last *10* data points of both, the original data time series and the shifted one.

Obviously, the shifted data series now exhibits a regular sampling rate of *10* minutes, with the index
ranging from the latest timestamp, that is a multiple of *10* minutes and precedes the initial timestamp
of the original data, up to the first *10* minutes multiple, that succeeds the last original data timestamp.
This is default behavior to all the :doc:`regularization <../funcs/resampling>` provided by ``saqc``.

Data Loss and Empty Intervals
-----------------------------

The number of data points  (displayed at the bottom of the table columns) has changed through the
transformation as well. That change stems from 2 sources mainly:

Empty Intervals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there is no :ref:`valid <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:valid data>` data point available within an interval of the passed frequency,
that could be shifted to match a multiple of the frequency, a ``NaN`` value gets inserted to represent the fact,
that in the interval that is represented by that date time index, there was data missing.

Valid Data
^^^^^^^^^^

Data points are referred to, as *valid*\ , in context of a regularization, if:


#.
   the data points value is not ``NaN``

#.
   the *flag* of that data point has a value lower than the value passed to the methods
   ``to_mask`` keyword - since this keyword defaults to the highest flag level available,
   by default, all data flagged :py:const:`~saqc.constants.BAD`, is considered invalid by that method.

Note, that, from point *2* above, it follows, that flagging data values
before regularization, will effectively exclude them from the regularization process. See chapter
:ref:`flagging and regularization <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:flags and regularization>` for an example of this effect and how it can help
control :ref:`data reduction <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:data reduction>`.

data reduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there are multiple values present within an interval with size according to the passed frequency alias passed to
``freq``\ , this values get reduced to one single value, that will get assigned to the timestamp associated with the
interval.

This reduction depends on the selected :doc:`regularization <../funcs/resampling>` method.

For example, :ref:`above <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:shift>`\ , we applied a backwards :py:meth:`~saqc.SaQC.shift` with a *10* minutes frequency.
As a result, the first value, encountered after any multiple of *10* minutes, gets shifted backwards to be aligned with
the desired frequency and any other value in that *10* minutes interval just gets discarded.

See the below chunk of our processed *SoilMoisture* data set to get an idea of the effect. There are 2 measurements
within the *10* minutes interval ranging from ``2021-01-01 07:30:00`` to ``2021-01-01 07:40:00`` present
in the original data - and only the first of the two reappears in the shifted data set, as representation
for that interval.

Minimize Shifting Distance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Notice, how, for example, the data point for ``2021-01-01 07:49:41`` gets shifted all the way back, to
``2021-01-01 07:40:00`` - although, shifting it forward to ``07:40:00`` would be less a manipulation, since this timestamp
appears to be closer to the original one.

To shift to any frequency aligned timestamp the value that is closest to that timestamp, we
can perform a *nearest shift* instead of a simple *back shift*\ , by using the shift method ``"nshift"``\ :

   >>> qc = qc.shift('SoilMoisture', target='SoilMoisture_nshift', freq='10min', method='nshift')
   >>> qc.data['2021-01-01T07:00:00':'2021-01-01T08:00:00'] # doctest: +SKIP
                SoilMoisture_nshift |                              SoilMoisture |
   ================================ | ========================================= |
   Date Time                        | Date Time                                 |
   2021-01-01 07:00:00      23.3431 | 2021-01-01 07:00:41               23.3431 |
   2021-01-01 07:10:00      23.3431 | 2021-01-01 07:10:29               23.3431 |
   2021-01-01 07:20:00      23.2988 | 2021-01-01 07:20:17               23.2988 |
   2021-01-01 07:30:00      23.3874 | 2021-01-01 07:30:05               23.3874 |
   2021-01-01 07:40:00      23.3853 | 2021-01-01 07:39:53               23.3853 |
   2021-01-01 07:50:00      23.3431 | 2021-01-01 07:49:41               23.3431 |

Now, any timestamp got assigned, the value that is nearest to it, *if* there is one valid data value available in the
interval surrounding that timestamp with a range of half the frequency. In our example, this would mean, the regular
timestamp would get assigned the nearest value of all the values, that precede or succeed it by less than *5* minutes.

Maybe check out, what happens with the chunk of the final 2 hours of our shifted *Soil Moisture* dataset, to get an idea.

   >>> qc.data['2021-03-20 07:00:00':] # doctest: +SKIP

   2021-03-20 08:30:00          NaN |                                           |

   2021-03-20 08:50:00          NaN |                                           |


Since there is no valid data available, for example, in the interval from ``2021-03-20 07:55:00`` to ``2021-03-20 08:05:00`` - the new value
for the regular timestamp ``2021-03-20 08:00:00``\ , that lies in the center of this interval, is ``NaN``.

Aggregation
-----------

If we want to comprise several values by aggregation and assign the result to the new regular timestamp, instead of
selecting a single one, we can do this, with the :py:meth:`~saqc.SaQC.resample` method.
Lets resample the *SoilMoisture* data to have a *20* minutes sample rate by aggregating every *20* minutes intervals
content with the arithmetic mean (which is provided by the ``numpy.mean`` function for example).

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> qc = qc.resample('SoilMoisture', target='SoilMoisture_mean', freq='20min', method='bagg', func=np.mean)
   >>> qc.data # doctest: +SKIP

Aggregation functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can pass arbitrary function objects to the ``func`` parameter, to be applied to calculate every intervals result,
as long as this function returns a scalar *float* value upon an array-like input. (So ``np.median`` would be proper
for calculating the median, ``sum``\ , for assigning the value sum, and so on.)

Aggregation method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As it is with the :ref:`shift <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:Shift>` functionality, a ``method`` keyword controls, weather the
aggregation result for the interval in between 2 regular timestamps gets assigned to the left (=\ ``bagg``\ ) or to the
right (\ ``fagg``\ ) boundary timestamp.


* Also, analogous to the shift functionality, intervals of size ``freq``\ , that do
  not contain any :ref:`valid <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:valid data>` data, that could be aggregated, get ``np.nan`` assigned.

Interpolation
-------------

Another common way of obtaining regular timestamps, is, the interpolation of data at regular timestamps.

In the pool of py:mod:`regularization <Functions.saqc.resampling>` methods, is available the
:py:meth:`~saqc.SaQC.interpolate` method.

Lets apply a linear interpolation onto the dataset. To access
linear interpolation, we pass the ``method`` parameter the string ``"time"``. This
applies an interpolation, that is sensitive to the difference in temporal gaps
(as opposed by ``"linear"``\ , which expects all the gaps to be equal). Get an overview
of the possible interpolation methods in the :py:meth:`~saqc.SaQC.interpolate>`
documentation. Lets check the results:

   >>> qc = qc.interpolate('SoilMoisture', target='SoilMoisture_linear', freq='10min', method='time')
   >>> qc.data # doctest: +SKIP

Interpolation and Data Sparsity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The regularization by interpolation is strict in the sense, that regular timestamps *only* get
interpolated, if they have at least one :ref:`valid <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:valid data>` data value preceding them *and* one
succeeding them *within* the given frequency range (which is controlled by the ``freq`` keyword.).

That's why, you have no interpolation value at ``2021-03-20 07:30:00`` - because it is preceded
by a :ref:`valid <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:valid data>` value at ``2021-03-20 07:26:16``\ , but there is no :ref:`valid <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:valid data>` value
available in between the succeeding *10* minutes interval from ``2021-03-20 07:30:00`` to ``2021-03-20 07:30:00``.

On the other hand, there is an interpolated value assigned to ``2021-03-20 07:50:00``\ , it is preceded by
a :ref:`valid <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:valid data>` value at ``2021-03-20 07:40:37`` and one succeeding at ``2021-03-20 07:54:59``.

This behavior is intended to reflect the sparsity of the original data in the
regularized data set. The behavior can be circumvented by applying the more general
:py:meth:`~saqc.SaQC.interpolateIndex`.

Linear Interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note, that there is a wrapper available for linear interpolation: :py:meth:`~saqc.SaQC.linear`.

Flags and Regularization
------------------------

Since data, that is flagged by a level higher or equal to the passed ``to_mask`` value
(default=:py:const:~saqc.constants.BAD), is not regarded :ref:`valid <cookbooks/DataRegularisation:valid data>` by the applied function,
it can be of advantage, to flag data before regularization in order to effectively exclude it
from the resulting regularly sampled data set. Lets see an example for the *SoilMoisture* data set.

>>> qc = qc.linear('SoilMoisture', target='SoilMoisture_linear', freq='10min') # doctest: +SKIP
>>> qc.data['2021-01-01 15:00:00':'2021-01-01 16:00:00'] # doctest: +SKIP
             SoilMoisture_linear |                              SoilMoisture |
================================ | ========================================= |
Date Time                        | Date Time                                 |
2021-01-01 15:00:00    23.341182 | 2021-01-01 15:00:51               23.3410 |
2021-01-01 15:10:00    23.342964 | 2021-01-01 15:10:38               23.3431 |
2021-01-01 15:20:00    23.341092 | 2021-01-01 15:20:26               23.3410 |
2021-01-01 15:30:00    23.341000 | 2021-01-01 15:30:14               23.3410 |
2021-01-01 15:40:00  -119.512446 | 2021-01-01 15:40:02             -120.0000 |
2021-01-01 15:50:00    23.299553 | 2021-01-01 15:49:50               23.2988 |

At ``2021-01-01 15:40:02`` the original data exhibits a measurement value
of ``-120`` - which is obviously not a valid data point, regarding the fact, that *SoilMoisture* measurements
should be percentage values in between *0* and *100*.

Since we don't exclude the value from interpolation, it gets included in the interpolation
process for the regular timestamp at ``2021-01-01 15:40:00`` - which, as a result, also exhibits
a nonsense value of *-119.512446*. We could now flag the resulting regular dataset and
exclude this calculated nonsense value from further processing and analysis.

But, this would introduce a small data gap at this point.

We can circumvent having that gap, by flagging that value before interpolation. This
works, because there is actually another, now valid value, available in the interval
in between ``2021-01-01 15:40:00`` and ``2021-01-01 15:50:00``\ , that can serve as right pillow point
for the interpolation at ``2021-01-01 15:40:00``. So lets flag all the values smaller than *0*
with the :py:meth:`~saqc.SaQC.flagRange` method and after this,
do the interpolation.

   >>> qc = qc.flagRange('SoilMoisture', min=0)
   >>> qc = qc.interpolate('SoilMoisture', freq='10min', method='time')
   >>> qc.data['2021-01-01T07:00:00':'2021-01-01T08:00:00'] # doctest: +SKIP
                       SoilMoisture |                     SoilMoisture_original |
