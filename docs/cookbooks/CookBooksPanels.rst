   .. grid-item-card:: Data Alignment
      :link: DataRegularisation
      :link-type: doc

      * modify data, so that its index exhibits a unary sampling rate
      * by: shifting, interpolating or aggregating it
      * but: conserve data gap structure
      * minimize and control value distortion from alignment
      * back-project calculated flags from the aligned data onto the original
      +++
      *Obtain representative data derivative sampled at an evenly spaced frequency grid*

      :link: OutlierDetection
      :link-type: doc

      * quickly set up a simple yet powerful outlier detection algorithm
      * learn to interprete and tune the parameters
      +++

      :link-type: doc

      * obtain data derivates through different modelling approaches
      * like rolling statistics or curve fits
      * obtain model errors and apply standard anomaly tests on those
      * project the result onto the original data
      +++
      *How to derive flagging assertions from error models*
